# Composition
Manage your compose sequences

## Usage

The program takes in `.compose` "fragment" files containing compose sequences (see examples in `/sample-fragments`).

You can then view all sequences and select the sequences or sequence groups you want to use and export it to a single `.XCompose` file.
